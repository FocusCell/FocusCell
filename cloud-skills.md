# Top 5 Skills Every Cloud Engineer Should Cultivate

Building well-architected workloads in AWS and Azure often breaks down into five core areas—**Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Operational Excellence**—each aligned to a pillar of the respective Well‑Architected Frameworks.

Organizations routinely struggle with:
- Identity and access misconfigurations
- Lack of resilience planning
- Inefficient scaling
- Runaway costs from overprovisioned or idle resources
- Missing infrastructure-as‑code and monitoring processes

Mastery in these areas not only helps teams pass their Well‑Architected Framework assessments but also underpins robust, secure, and cost‑effective cloud solutions.

## 1. Security Engineering

Many cloud workloads fail assessments due to:
- Overly permissive IAM roles (e.g., using the root account for daily operations)
- Incomplete encryption at rest and in transit
- Neglected key rotation
- Inadequate logging and monitoring (e.g., omitting CloudTrail in AWS or Log Analytics in Azure)

## 2. Reliability & Resiliency Design

Common pitfalls include:
- Running services in a single Availability Zone or region without backups or failover plans
- Skipping failure mode and effects analysis
- Poor planning for blast radius and recovery actions

## 3. Performance Efficiency Architecting

Teams often struggle with:
- Lack of autoscaling or manually sized resources
- Performance bottlenecks or overprovisioning
- Missing instrumentation and performance triage (e.g., no APM integration or live‑site issue playbooks)

**Certifications to validate and build this skill:**
- **AWS**: [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/)
- **Azure**: [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert (AZ‑305)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/)

## 4. Cost Optimization

Cost surges often result from:
- Idle or overprovisioned EC2 instances and storage
- Neglecting Reserved Instances or Savings Plans (can save up to 75%)
- Skipping tagging strategies (affects cost allocation and reporting)

**Certifications to validate and build this skill:**
- **AWS**: [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)
- **Azure**: [Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ‑900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-fundamentals/)

## 5. Operational Excellence & DevOps Practices

Challenges include:
- Manual deployments and lack of infrastructure as code
- Missing runbooks or playbooks
- No integrated CI/CD, automated testing, or monitoring dashboards
